This is the repository for the Kochi chapter of Papers We Love. As a local chapter we follow the Papers We Love [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/papers-we-love/kochi/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).

### When & Where?

### What is Papers We Love?

Papers We Love (PWL) is a community built around reading, discussing, and learning more about academic computer science papers.

What was the last paper within the realm of computing you read and  loved? What did it inspire you to build or tinker with? Come share the  ideas in an awesome academic/research paper with fellow engineers,  programmers, and paper-readers. Lead a session and show off code that  you wrote that implements these ideas or just give us the lowdown about  the paper. Otherwise, just come, listen, and discuss.

### Who are we?

We are developers,students,entrepreneurs and other tech professionals hailing from the southern Indian state of Kerala. Whether you're a student or a professional or someone just starting off, we welcome you in. The only requirements are respect and a love towards technology.
